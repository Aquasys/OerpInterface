Simple interface to connect to an OpenERP database using XMLRPC (might be replaced with JSONRPC in the next version).

XML-RPC requests have been simplified to look more like django queries (very basic though, no OR, __startswith etc), 
extending it should be quite easy.

To use it :
 - Create an instance of OerpClient with the required informations
 - QueryManager is used to do the CRUD operations provided by OpenERP
 - OerpModel is the container for the openerp data and CUD operations needs to provide one to the query manager
